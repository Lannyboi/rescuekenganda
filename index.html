    <h1>Rescue Kenganda</h1>
    <h2>Understand</h2>
    <p>In a man's world where females are valued only as property, vulnerable young girls are shamed out of school into a lucrative market for uneducated circumcised girls. They are mutilated in the barbaric, irreversible practice of FGM, setting them up for a life of pain, isolation, and servitude. Heroic young ladies have escaped to schools that are safe, who otherwise would have been brutalized, and forced to submit to FGM and child marriage. Rescue Kenganda is aiding them in finding safety and freedom. The girls receive an initial menstrual hygiene kit and are trained in using them, enabling them to side-step the culturally-imposed shame placed on them for their monthly cycle.</p>
